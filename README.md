‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen utilizes industry-standard protocols like [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for generating Bitcoin addresses. For EVM-based chains, like Ethereum, it employs [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing.

The software rapidly generates potential wallet addresses and compares them against a database of known addresses or, alternatively, performs real-time balance checks via public blockchain explorers. 

Wallet Gen is written in C++ and benefits from its open-source nature, allowing users to access and modify the code as needed.  Compared to Python-based alternatives, Wallet Gen offers significantly faster wallet generation, primarily leveraging your CPU & GPU for optimal performance.

##  Why WalletGen?

**WalletGen** is designed with performance in mind. Written in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU utilization, it delivers performance that can be **up to 10x faster** than many Python-based brute-force tools. Whether you're exploring forgotten wallets, assessing private key spaces, or looking to recover your own wallet, WalletGen enables you to do so efficiently and securely.

## Features

-   **Create Cryptocurrency Wallets:** Wallet Gen makes it easy to create individual wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, MATIC and other cryptocurrencies.
-   **Find Wallets with Balance:** Employing brute-force techniques, Wallet Gen can search for existing wallets that contain balances, on both the Bitcoin network and EVMs.
-   **Support for Diverse Algorithms:** Keccak256 is used for EVM wallets, while BIP39, BIP44, and Bech32 are implemented for Bitcoin wallet generation.
-   **Database Integration for Speed:** Utilize downloadable databases to supercharge your searches for balance-holding wallets, vastly accelerating the process.
-   **High-Performance Operation:** Wallet Gen is engineered to leverage both CPU and GPU power to achieve top-tier performance.
-   **Bitcoin Wallet Recovery:** WalletGen offers functionality to recover your Bitcoin wallet through the seed phrase (mnemonic phrase).

## Supported Blockchains

-   Bitcoin (BTC)
-   Ethereum (ETH)
-   Binance Smart Chain (BNB)
-   Any EVM-compatible chain

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** supports brute-force searching for two primary types of crypto wallets with existing balances.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Press key 3 in the menu, or run start_search_btc.bat to search for Bitcoin wallets via the internet. This approach may be slower, as it involves real-time balance checks through blockchain explorers.
*   Press key 6 to search for Bitcoin wallets using the database. This method provides faster performance by comparing generated wallets against a pre-compiled database of known, balance-containing addresses.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press key 5, or execute start_search_evm.bat to search EVM wallets using the internet. This method confirms the presence of balances in real-time through blockchain explorers.
*   Press key 6 to search for EVM wallets using the database. This approach is more efficient because it compares generated wallets against an existing database of addresses known to hold balances.

### Speed Considerations:

*   The speed of the search is significantly influenced by your hardware, especially the graphics card (GPU). To optimize speed and increase the likelihood of finding a wallet with a balance, consider running multiple program instances (1 to 4), dependent on your system's capabilities.

Leveraging the database dramatically enhances search efficiency, eliminating the need to query the blockchain for every wallet generated.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

Upon discovering a wallet with a balance, the program will:
*   **Immediately Stop** the search.
*   **Display** the wallet details on the console.
*   **Save** this information within the ``found_wallets.txt`` file.

### Accessing Your Funds:
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the discovered wallet into a compatible crypto wallet (e.g., Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  Following restoration, you can transfer the funds to your wallet.

> If you find a successful match, please consider sharing a small portion of the found balance as a token of appreciation. Thank you!

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen includes functionality to recover your bitcoin wallet using your seed phrase (mnemonic phrase). The software supports entering the complete seed phrase, as well as searching for missing words using specific characters.

### Process Explanation

#### Searching for Missing Words:

If you are missing words or unsure of your seed phrase, substitute those words with *. WalletGen will explore all possible word variations in the * positions to identify the correct seed phrase, and restore the related wallet balance.

#### Entering a Complete Seed Phrase:

If you possess the full 12-word seed phrase, simply enter it with spaces. WalletGen will generate different address types (Legacy, SegWit, P2SH) and confirm their balances.

### Key Recommendations

*   Seed phrases must include exactly 12 words.
*   Utilize only the * symbol to designate missing words.
*   Searching for missing words can be time-intensive, particularly with multiple missing words.
*   Successful wallet recovery with a balance will result in the program automatically halting and saving the discovered information.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/upload/clone.webp)


I've personally recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first contained 0.000032 BTC, while the second had 0.0528 BTC (approximately $4800 at the time of discovery).  
Here‚Äôs the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).
